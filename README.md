Note: I have essentially completed Assignment 3 for WEBWare. Unfortunately, when I try to import my project to Glitch.com, it does not work. When I run my program locally, however, the program works perfectly. I was wondering if there was another way I could get my work submitted/graded because it's done, but it is unable to be uploaded. I even worked with Parker (TA) for over an hour, and he is unsure of what to do as well. Please let me know what to do when you can, as I really want to resolve this issue.

Thank you,

Winston

## Study Scheduler

Glitch link: http://a3-twinz300.glitch.me

The goal of my application was to allow users to log in with their credentials, plan when and for how long they would like to study for, and allow the users to edit their plans as well. In making the application, I struggled with ensuring all of the data associated with a specific user displayed properly. I also struggled to make sure that the username was displayed on the screen as well when logged in. For authentication, I chose to use a username and password. I did this because it’s the standard, and I was not sure how to develop a more complex authentication within the time limit. I used the mvp.css framework. I chose this one because the framework looks professional, fun, and inviting at the same time. It also was fairly easy to manipulate. I gave the various instructions on the official application page different colors to make them easier to distinguish. I also made my buttons black and yellow so they would stand out.

## Technical Achievements

**Technical Achievement 1** : I achieved a 100% across all four Lighthouse tests on both pages of my creation.




**Technical Achievement 2** : I utilized cookie-session so the app would remember the user and their submissions, and keep the information stored.

## Design Achievements

**Design Achievement 1**: I implemented 12 accessibility tips.

**Tip 1: Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels.**
I looked at each of my form elements and surrounded them with label tags.<br />
**Tip 2: Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify.**
I made the buttons on my application page large, black, and yellow, which contrasts greatly with the rest of my webpage.<br />
**Tip 3: Associate a label with every form control.**
For the hours, days, username, password, etc., I either used label or label for=””  in my html files.<br />
**Tip 4: Reflect the reading order in the code order.**
I constructed my pages from top to bottom so everything would be easy for me to find when designing and viewing my webpage.<br />
**Tip 5: Provide informative, unique page titles.**
My page titles said exactly what needed to be said. I wanted there to be no question about what each page represents.<br />
**Tip 6: Keep content clear and concise.**
I made sure to keep my sentences brief and to not over explain what needs to be done. <br />
**Tip 7: Provide Clear Instructions.**
I made sure to be direct and leave little to no room for ambiguity. <br />

**Tip 8: Use headings and spacing to group related content.**
The area to modify submissions is in one group and the area to create/delete submissions is in another group. The submissions themselves appear in a group of their own. <br />

**Tip 9: Use headings to convey meaning & structure.**
I made sure that main ideas/titles were on the “outermost” layers, and they were direct. I sectioned blocks of text among the “inner” layers to increase readability. <br />

**Tip 10: Provide easily identifiable feedback.**
On my login page, I would let users know if they left a box blank and if they used the wrong password. <br />

**Tip 11: Provide sufficient contrast between foreground & background.**
I made a conscious effort to make the text very different from the color of the page in the background. I mainly used relatively dark shades of colors. <br />

**Tip 12: Create designs for different viewport sizes.**
I specifically added space between the username and password blocks on my login page so the page wouldn’t be structured awkwardly for people on mobile devices.
